Play Pong
-----------
Train an agent to play Pong using pixels.  

### Description:
This project is aimed to teach a reinforcement learning "REINFORCE" agent to play Pong (atari) using pixels. Reinforce are policy gradient methods in which the agent directly optimizes for the policy. This repo contains the vanila "REINFORCE" algorithm and other enhancements such as Importance Sampling and Proximal Policy Optimization.

### Implemented Functionality:
   * Vanila REINFORCE: 
   * Importance Sampling: Used to overcome the poor credit assignment problems with vanila REINFORCE
   * Proximal Policy Optimization: Used to overcome poor approximation between Old and New policies.
